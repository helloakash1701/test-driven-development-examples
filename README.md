# Test-Driven Development Examples

This repository contains examples of code developed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each example demonstrates the process of writing tests before implementing the actual code, helping to ensure reliable and well-tested software.

## Examples

### Calculator

The `Calculator` directory contains a simple calculator implementation developed using TDD principles. It includes a `Calculator` class and a corresponding `CalculatorTest` class.

The `CalculatorTest` class demonstrates how to write tests for the calculator's functionality, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each test is written before the actual code implementation and ensures that the calculator behaves as expected.

## Getting Started

To explore the code examples and run the tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/helloakash1701/test-driven-development-examples.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

3. Navigate to the specific example directory you're interested in (e.g., `Calculator`).

4. Run the corresponding test class to execute the tests. You can either run the individual test methods or run the entire test class, depending on your IDE's capabilities.

5. View the test results to see if all the tests pass or if any failures or errors occur. Investigate any failures to understand any potential issues with the code.

## Contributing
